# Screenshots

This directory contains screenshots of the AquaHaven app for the README.md file.

## Required Screenshots

1. `home.png` - Home screen of the app
2. `list.png` - Fish list screen with search and filters
3. `details.png` - Fish details screen

## Adding New Screenshots

1. Take screenshots using Flutter's `screenshot` package or device emulator
2. Save them in this directory with a descriptive name
3. Update the paths in README.md if filenames change
4. Keep the file sizes reasonable (under 500KB each)

## Screenshot Guidelines

- Use a light theme for consistency
- Capture on a device or emulator with a resolution of 1080x1920 or similar
- Show the most important features in each screenshot
- Keep the UI clean and uncluttered
- Add subtle shadows or device frames if desired
